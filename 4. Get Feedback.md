"The agentic system takes the paper PDF and optional target venue as input. It first converts the PDF into a Markdown document using LandingAI's Agentic Document Extraction (ADE). It then extracts the paper title and verifies the document is an academic paper as a sanity check. To ground the paper review in the latest prior work, the agent analyzes the paper to generate web search queries of different levels of specificity. The search phrases aim to cover different perspectives, such as relevant benchmarks/baselines, other papers addressing the same problem, and papers with related techniques. These queries are then executed using the Tavily search API to find relevant papers on arXiv. The agent then downloads the metadata (title, authors, abstracts) of those papers. To balance coverage and context length, the agent evaluates the relevance of each related work using this metadata to select the most relevant papers; it then chooses an appropriate summarization method for each of the top related papers, choosing between using the existing abstract from the downloaded metadata or generating a detailed summary from the full text. If it elects to create a detailed summary, the agent also specifies the most salient focus areas for summary creation. It then downloads the paper PDFs from arXiv, converts the PDF to Markdown, and uses an LLM to generate a detailed summary given the Markdown and focus areas. Finally, the agent uses both the original paper's Markdown and the newly synthesized related work summaries to generate a comprehensive review following a template."
