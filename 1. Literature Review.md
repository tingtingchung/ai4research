In addition to tools that the university libraries recommend, here are a few options:

1. **[OpenScholar](https://openscilm.allen.ai/)** is a free and open-source tool that combines a language model with a database of 45 million open-access articles to stop the system from making up or ‘hallucinating’ citations.     
The authors publish their methods and model weights in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199).  
However, the result is limited by the database they used.

2. We can also use the **Deep Research** mode of ChatGPT but that comes with a cost. However, ChatGPT's model may be able to retrieve more current literature.

3. **[Scholar Labs](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2025/11/scholar-labs-ai-powered-scholar-search.html)** analyzes a research question to identify its key topics, aspects and relationships. 
Scholar Labs search for all of them on Google Scholar, and evaluates the results to identify papers that answer the overall research question. 
For each paper, it provides a brief description of how the paper helps answer your question, and includes all the familiar Scholar features.

4. Use OpenAI's [Prism](https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism/) (free so far), designed for scientific paper writing. Notable advantages are:
- Prism writes paper in Latex style, and so it's super convenient if your paper includes math equations.
- You can brainstorm with Prism for all sections of your paper.
- Prism shows edit suggestions line by line so you can review and approve changes easily.
