Use [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) or [Google AI Studio/Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com) to collect data.

See [an example posted by Dr. Andrew Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413610180048818177/), political science professor at Stanford and [his analysis of Claude's accuracy](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-hall-40a88444_last-weekend-i-posted-that-claude-code-created-activity-7415427510546673665-jqHy/?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAAliRUoB-r95kFWvbQ-eKjrGmitvygfhjzo). The entire project, including his [Claude prompt](https://github.com/andybhall/vbm-replication-extension/blob/main/CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md) is available on his [repo](https://github.com/andybhall/vbm-replication-extension).  

Here're prompts to replicate this paper, based on Hall's original prompt design. 
I want to replicate and extend this working paper: Hybrid Data can Enhance the Utility of Synthetic Data for Training Anti-Money Laundering Models. arXiv:2509.18499. The paper studies  the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. I have the original data files and code here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SjvpC118VUnAudF00Huzv7TbwA7GJgUd. Please set up the project structure and review the original materials.
