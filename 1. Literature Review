**OpenScholar** combines a language model with a database of 45 million open-access articles to stop the system from making up or ‘hallucinating’ citations.  
OpenScholar's online demo is available [here](https://openscilm.allen.ai/) for free.    
The authors publish their methods and model weights in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199).  
However, the result is limited by the database they used.

We can also use the "Deep Research" mode of ChatGPT but that comes with a cost. However, ChatGPT's model may be able to retrieve more current literature.

We can also use [Scholar Labs](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2025/11/scholar-labs-ai-powered-scholar-search.html), which analyzes a research question to identify its key topics, aspects and relationships. 
Scholar Labs search for all of them on Google Scholar, and evaluates the results to identify papers that answer the overall research question. 
For each paper, it provides a brief description of how the paper helps answer your question, and includes all the familiar Scholar features.
