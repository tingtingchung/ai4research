You can ask Claude to replicate a study, if you provide instructions about how to source the datasets.  

See [an example posted by Dr. Andrew Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413610180048818177/), political science professor at Stanford and [his analysis of Claude's accuracy](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-hall-40a88444_last-weekend-i-posted-that-claude-code-created-activity-7415427510546673665-jqHy/?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAAliRUoB-r95kFWvbQ-eKjrGmitvygfhjzo). The entire project, including his [Claude prompt](https://github.com/andybhall/vbm-replication-extension/blob/main/CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md) is available on his [repo](https://github.com/andybhall/vbm-replication-extension).
